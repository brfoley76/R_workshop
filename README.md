The R module has a root folder containing the presentation, readable html, and source code. These will be the primary files we're going to use for the workshop.
    "Presentation.R.html" = R markdown presentation, html output 
        (should pop open in your browser when you click it)
    "Presentation.R.rmd" = R markdown presentation, source code
        (plain text. This will open in RStudio once we install rmarkdown)
        
There are also 2 subfolders.
    ./raw_data contains the 2 example data sets we're going to use.
         gardenia: 
            gardenia.csv = the gardenia dataset 
            gardenia.txt = the readme for the gardenia project       
         snark
            snark.measures.xlsx = the data file for the snark project produced by Dr. Lewis
            "tierra del fuego snark measurements.xls" = the data file for the snark project produced by her postdoc Ali Bellman. Sadly, neither Lewis nor Bellman produced anything like a readme file.
            
     ./figures contains the figures referenced in Presentation.R.rmd
        desktop.jpg = a screen grab of a cluttered desktop with some wicked classic Nintendo games
            http://board.kafuka.org/thread.php?id=30&page=8
        gardenia.jpg = a fully grown gardenia in bloom
             From Little Shop of Horrors (1988)
        snark.jpg = a fortuitously exact version of the snark I'd imagined. Apparently from a video game (Half Life) but sculpted by the talented Wispy Chipmunk of DeviantArt. http://wispychipmunk.deviantart.com/art/Mini-Snark-Sculpture-394639875     
        zombigenic_beaver.jpg = a specimen of the temperate/nearctic zombigenic beaver. From the documentary nature film Zombeaver (2014), presumably *not* starring Sir David Attenborough.
