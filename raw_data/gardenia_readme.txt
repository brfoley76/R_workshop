Several friends from differnt universities were involved in a hardy-gardenia breeding contest. The gardenias are to be used to terraform Mars, so they need to be tough. The gardenias were scored for several traits indicative of vigor.
    name = contestant's name
    uni = the institution at which they work
    height = the height of the gardenia in inches a month after germination
    leaf_number = the number of leaves on the plant a month after germination
    flowering_time = the number of months post germination at which the plants first flowered. Remember, the faster they propagate, the faster Mars will be green.
