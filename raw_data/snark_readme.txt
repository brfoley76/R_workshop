The snark measurement data collected by Carol and Ali share the same file structure. Happily, they saved the data as .csv! They collected four physical measures over five days (three days apart), in larval Conniptus hemifittus: cephalocalypsis length, width and area, as well as a body size proxy - abdothorax length. Carol's data is called lewis_snark.csv; Ali's data is called bellman_snark.csv
